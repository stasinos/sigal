""" This plugin modifies titles of galleries by using regular-expressions and
simple string or character replacements. It is acting in two phases: First, all
regular-expression-based modifications are carried out, second, string/character
replacements are done.

The first phase may be interrupted if a match occurs by the 'break'-setting
individually per regular-expression part. Additionally, if a match occurs,
string/character replacements may be added.

The second phase is done even if the first phase had been interrupted.

Settings:

- ``titleregexp`` with the following keys:
    - ``regexp``, which is an array of dicts with 'search', 'replace', 'break'
      'substitute' and 'count' keys. All but 'break' and 'substitute' are the
      arguments for ``re.subn``, without given 'count' all matches are replaced.
      If 'break' is anything but an empty string, the rest of the
      ``regexp``-array is being skipped. The 'substitute'-key contains an array
      following the ``substitute`` format explained in the next sentence and
      does string-replacement if the regular-expression matched.
    - ``substitute``, which is an array of 2-element-arrays, of which the
      occurences of the first element will be replaced by the second element by
      the ``replace``-method of strings.

Example::

    titleregexp = {
        'regexp' : [
            { 'search': r"^([0-9]*)-(.*)$", 'replace': r"\\2 (\\1)", 'count': 1,
              'break': 1, substitute: [ ['ae','Ã¤'] ] },
            { 'search': r"([a-z][a-z])([A-Z][a-z])", 'replace': r"\\1 \\2" }
            ],
        'substitute' : [ [ '_', ' ' ] ]
    }
